## Design Decisions

* **Component-Based Architecture:**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built using a modular structure by splitting functionality into small, reusable components.
* **Theme Management:**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light/Dark mode is handled by adding/removing a .dark class from the <body> and changing CSS accordingly.
* **Animations:**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added hover zoom effects and smooth transitions on buttons for better user engagement.
* **Responsiveness:**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexbox layouts and rem-based sizing ensure the app looks good across devices.
* **Font Choices:**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markazi Text font from Google Fonts was chosen for modern and clean typography.
* **Accessibility Considerations:**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large clickable areas and appropriate color contrasts for better usability.
